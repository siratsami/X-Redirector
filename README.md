# x-redirector
HTTP redirect scanner

Is a tool is designed by [B4GG3R](https://www.facebook.com/siratsami71) for BugBounty hunters who wants to open redirect vulnerability
It's the first tool tool I made and it works with `curl` & `bash`.

The tool looks for the URLs which are redirecting by "X-Forwarded-Host" HTTP header.

I'm apologise if there's any bug or something, well just like I said it's my first tool
A simple but great tool...!

Hope you all enjoy
Good luck <3
